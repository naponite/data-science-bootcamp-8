## Introduction

Study the diamonds dataset to explore the interesting insight by 5 charts

## 1. Carat and Price relationship

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat,price, col=cut))+
  geom_point(size=0.8)+
  facet_wrap(~cut, ncol=2)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col="red")+
  stat_cor(method = "pearson", label.x = 3, label.y = 30)+
  theme_minimal()

```


```{r}
cor(diamonds$carat, diamonds$price)

```
The correlation of carat and price group by cut is about 0.86 - 0.93

And overview correlation of carat and price is about 0.92


## 2. Carat distribution group by clarity

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, carat))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, carat))+
  geom_violin()+
  theme_minimal()

```


From the distribution chart, higher diamond clarity is difficult to found in high carat diamonds (can refer from violin chart).

Or can said that "More carat have more possibility to found the flaw"



### Diamond Color and Clarity chart

## 3. Diamondd price density and histogram chart
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(price))+
  geom_histogram(fill = "orange")+
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(diamonds, aes(price))+
  geom_density(col = "red")+
  theme_minimal()
```


The histogram and density chart shown that the less supply diamonds, the price will go higher Meaning "The diamond price is depend on the rarity"
